# AutomatePPTusingPython

This works simply uses the power of Python for easing our lives. The main theme of this project is to use python for making a presentation that has template(one or several) and populate that template from a huge data stored in an excel. This project is specific to a senario, as explained below for easy understanding. But having said that, doesn't make the repository obsolete. Anyone can extend the work for a similar scenario.

## Scenario
The problem at hand is that we have to create a felicitation PPT for a group of 800 students, which will be displayed on screen while the students will recieve medals/gitfs on stage. There are some constraints and requirements for making a PPT, like : depending on where the students stands, accordingly his details have to be shown on slides. </br>
For example a student with rank >700 out 800, only name needs to be displayed. For students having rank between 300-400 name along with some scores, for student in top 100 more details and space has to be given and for top 5 entire silde has to be dedicated, which should include photo etc. 
More details about constraints in this work are there in the [Instructions and documentation](Instructions+documentation.docx) file.
